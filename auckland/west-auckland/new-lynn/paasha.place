summary: Zeki Bay and Tracey Jamella Farry have owned umpteen restaurants in London,
  Sydney and, um, New Lynn. It doesnâ€™t look like it, but what sets this place apart
  is the charcoal grill and the house-made sauces (tahini is standard), which elevate
  the humble kebab to its rightfully glorious status. They also have another Paasha
  at 444 Glenfield Rd, Glenfield.
