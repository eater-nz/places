summary: Owner Francesco Acri scored top marks in his pizzaiolo exams in his hometown
  Naples this year, and has also just won a spot competing in next yearâ€™s World Pizza
  Champs in Parma. His dough is proved for 20 hours and cooked in a blistering manuka-fired
  oven. Pizzas here are generous in both girth and toppings, and the early-dining
  deal ($15 for pizza and Peroni) is unbeatable value.
