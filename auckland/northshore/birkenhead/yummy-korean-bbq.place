summary: The food is really good, but itâ€™s the enthusiastic service that makes this
  tiny place great. The menu runs through Korean standards; our favourite are the
  soups, which come out bubbling in superheated earthernware bowls. Try the ox bone,
  with big chunks of beef and greens and a simple broth.
