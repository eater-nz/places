summary: 'What sets Yue’s apart is, yes, the dumplings, whose fillings deliver on
  the menu’s promise: there’s lots of coriander when it says coriander, and lots of
  celery when it says celery, so the flavours are quite distinct. Dumplings aside,
  the little specials board near the entrance is worth keeping an eye on — we were
  recently rewarded with a great slow-cooked chicken dish with mushrooms and vermicelli
  noodles. And we love their broccoli; a very simple dish, the broccoli is just wok
  fried with garlic, but it’s perfectly cooked and very fresh.'
