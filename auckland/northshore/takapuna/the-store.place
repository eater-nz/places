summary: Hip Groupâ€™s beachfront restaurants each have a takeaway arm. At Takapuna
  (and also at Kohi Corner and St Heliers), you can skip the wait for a table by ordering
  from a shorter menu of gourmet fish and chips, wagyu cheeseburgers and filling seasonal
  salads to go. Tease the seagulls by eating on the beach, and then return for gelato.
