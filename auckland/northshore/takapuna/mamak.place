summary: 'Mamak Malaysian in the central city has been on our list for some years,
  but owner Jeffery Ng sold up a while back and returned to Malaysia. He kept ownership
  of the name, though, and now heâ€™s back, with a new place in Takapuna. We love it
  already: great wok hei dishes like the hawker standard wat tan hor (smooth, egg-fried
  noodles) sit alongside mee goreng, laksa and the chilli-rich sambal chicken.'
