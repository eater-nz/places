summary: Owner Jacky Lam comes from good stock; his mum, 'Aunty KK', owns popular
  restaurant KK Malaysian in Epsom, so he knows his food. The short menu at his new,
  minimalist venture includes smaller serves of KK-esque curry laksa, curry chicken
  with rice and several roti wraps â€” flavourful meat and crisp vegetables wrapped
  inside buttery, flaky roti.
