summary: Crispy pork, roast ducks and barbecue chickens swing from hooks in the window,
  and you order them by weight, or in quarters, halves or whole. The wat tan hor (smooth
  egg gravy over silky rice noodles), piled high with mushrooms, bok choy and slices
  of tender pork, is rather delicious, as is the crispy squid. The generous menu also
  includes a succinct casserole list. Great for groups.
