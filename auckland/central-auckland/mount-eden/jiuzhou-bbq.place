summary: As well as hand-shaved noodles, hot pots and, of course, barbecue, Jiuzhou
  BBQ serves Dezhou chicken, a fried and aromatic braised dish. Itâ€™s their specialty,
  all the way from Shandong province, and cooked from a recipe dating back more than
  300 years. There are ample toys, too, to keep the kids happy.
