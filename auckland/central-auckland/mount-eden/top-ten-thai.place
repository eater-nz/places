summary: 'Thai food as it should be: good protein serves, sweet but not cloyingly
  so, vegetables that arenâ€™t all bamboo shoots. Top Ten is primarily a takeaway, but
  it does have a few tables. With its well-balanced flavours and proportions and friendly
  service to boot, it is a treasure amid all those Chinese outlets.'
