summary: 'Breakfast, lunch or dinner, Kiss Kiss has got you covered. We love their
  spiced sticky ribs and whole deep-fried snapper. The pad thai, which nails the balance
  of hot, sour and sweet, is filled with huge chunks of prawn rather than shrimpy
  little shrimps. Bonus: you read the drinks lists through an actual View Master.
  Itâ€™s almost too old-school cool.'
