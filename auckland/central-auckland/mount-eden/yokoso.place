summary: 'They have a window on to the street for takeout, while inside itâ€™s all woody
  rusticity with live vibes provided, on occasion, by the ukulele-strumming owner.
  The simple menu delivers value and gratification aplenty, from the comprehensive
  sushi selection to the crunchy sauce katsu don: deep-fried pork and rice slathered
  in sweetish sauce and drizzled with Japanese mayo.'
