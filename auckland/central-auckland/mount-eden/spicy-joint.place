summary: Despite the name, there are plenty of non-spicy dishes to be had, and the
  ownerâ€™s grandchildren do a lovely job of helping to translate, in between watching
  cartoons  in Mandarin. If you like the tongue-tingle of Sichuan pepper, try the
  mapo tofu, and we love the Sichuan dumplings, too.
