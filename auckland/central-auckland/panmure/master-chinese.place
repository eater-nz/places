summary: Takeaway roast and BBQ meats do a roaring trade here, because, as the locals
  know, they serve the best roast pork with skin so crispy you canâ€™t stop eating.
  Start your meal with a complimentary lai thong (everyday soup), and follow it with
  crispy-skinned egg tofu. (Tofu sceptic? This will convert you.) The Peking duck
  done three ways is fabulous, too.
