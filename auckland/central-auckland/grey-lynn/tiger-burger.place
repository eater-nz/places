summary: 'In a Venn diagram of 2015â€™s hippest foods, Tiger Burger sits bang in the
  middle. The menu of Korean-inspired burgers changes regularly, though pulled pork
  and spicy kimchi, served in a preservative-free Wild Wheat bun, is a justified staple.
  And you really have to try the kimchi fries: crunchy hand-cut agria chips doused
  in chilli sauce. Who knew fermented cabbage would pair so excellently with Colby
  cheese?'
