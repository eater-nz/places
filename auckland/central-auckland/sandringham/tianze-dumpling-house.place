summary: 'Eggplant may not spring to mind as the stand-out dish at a dumpling house,
  but believe us when we say the pork-stuffed eggplant at Tianze is so very good.
  The fried green beans are a favourite, too. And so are their dumplings: as good
  as anywhere else in town, we think, especially when theyâ€™re fried.'
