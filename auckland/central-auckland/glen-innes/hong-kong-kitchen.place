summary: 'A traditional eatery with all the expected attractions: roast pork served
  many ways, honey BBQ pork, roast duck and soy chicken served on rice or in noodle
  soup. On a recent visit, one of our judges, taking the advice of his aunties to
  “be adventurous because you will be well rewarded”, chose the braised eggplant and
  salted fish casserole, along with the pan lum tau foo (tofu and fish). His verdict?
  Always listen to your aunties.'
