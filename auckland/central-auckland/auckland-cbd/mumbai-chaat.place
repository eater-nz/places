summary: 'The bright yellow interior, the hand-scrawled specials of the day, the generally
  cheerful bare-bones feel of the place, the sublime, generously portioned Mumbai-style
  street food: is there anything not to like about Mumbai Chaat? The masala dosa is
  a thing of perfection, with a crunchy pancake protecting a tender, lightly spiced
  potato interior. The thalis, though, are the best value â€” a selection of vegetarian
  curries with roti, pickles, dhal and rice. That the staff are as welcoming and helpful
  as they are is all the more unexpected in this little gem.'
