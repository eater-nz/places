summary: An affordable, bright, energetic dining room right near the Civic and the
  Aotea Centre â€” this is the ideal corner bolthole for a pre- or post-theatre feed.
  The king-prawn crispy fried-egg noodles are heaped with prawns almost as crispy
  as the noodles, and great value at $13. The dry-fried round beans with mince pork
  are moreish and deeply savoury, and a whole roast duck to take away is only $30.
