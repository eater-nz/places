summary: Get in, eat, get out is the vibe at this nonetheless friendly Korean restaurant.
  Good luck getting a table at weekday lunchtimes when hordes of workers from nearby
  offices drop in for soups served in cauldron-like pots, spicy gochujang-laden stir
  fries and crisply fried kimchi or seafood pancakes. Each comes served on a tray,
  most with steamed rice and four side dishes, or banchan, of which the kimchi and
  pickled daikon are particularly good. We also love the tteokbokki â€” chewy rice cakes
  and slivers of fish sausage served in a slightly sweet and very spicy sauce.
