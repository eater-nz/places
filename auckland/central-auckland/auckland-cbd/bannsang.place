summary: 'Why does that queue stretch out of the door so often? Because inside you
  can find delicious galbijjim: short beef ribs with the special house sauce and vegetables
  in a vermicelli bone broth. Weâ€™re also partial to the ojigo bulgogi (spicy squid
  and marinated beef), and the dishes all come with tasty Korean accompaniments.'
