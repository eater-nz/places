summary: Like the (now-closed) Little Sheep Hotpot, which was in this spot before,
  you cook your own food at Master Bowl in a simmering bowl of stock. The big difference
  is Master Bowlâ€™s version is Sichuan, so be prepared for aromatic, mouth-numbing
  sichuan peppers. Try the half-and-half hot pot, but save room for the fragrant dan-dan
  noodles and crispy spring onion pancakes. A cooling cucumber salad is advised.
