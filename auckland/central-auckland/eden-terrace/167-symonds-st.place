summary: Noodles made in-house swimming in broths simmered for days, topped with slices
  of perfectly roasted pork â€” this is where you come to feed your soul. Shrimp-flavoured
  spicy miso and the umami bomb gyokai also keep us coming back. There are many places
  for ramen in Auckland, but this humble owner-operated restaurant, which started
  with little more than a few outdoor tables, is hard to go past.
